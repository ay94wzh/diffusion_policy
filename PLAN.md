# Plan: view-generalizable policy

Direction and the original predictions: `PROPOSAL.md`. The module, its measured behaviour and
the open questions: `PROGRESS.md`. Operational detail, runbooks and traps: `NOTES.md`.
Last updated 2026-09-30.

## Constraints

- This is a fork of the original diffusion_policy repo — **modify it as little as
  possible**. Each milestone lands as **new files**; existing files are touched only at
  documented seams and only when unavoidable.
- Baselines first, then one part added at a time. Models are planned here, coded in their
  own milestone, and each milestone reads its result before the next one is committed to.
- **Where things run.** This checkout is the **coding and documents** machine: code, documents
  and the committed records (`data/eval_*/eval_log.json`, `data/outputs/run_*/logs.json.txt`,
  `data/screen_*`, `data/probe_*`) live here. The demonstrations, the multi-view zarrs and every
  checkpoint live on the **remote training machine**. Runs are prepared here and launched there;
  the results come back as `eval_log.json` + `logs.json.txt` and are written into `PROGRESS.md`.
  Check disk on the training machine before a campaign — a checkpoint is 4.6 GB and `topk.k=1`
  roughly doubles a run's footprint.
- Every run uses **201 epochs, not 200**: checkpoint and rollout fire on `epoch % 50 == 0` and
  there is no save at the end of training, so 201 makes epoch 200 fire.

## Status

Numbers and their provenance live in `PROGRESS.md`; this table is verdicts only.

| milestone | status | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **M1** — single-view baseline + novel-view harness | ✅ done | collapses to ≈0 at ±15° azimuth |
| **M2** — multi-view data (13-pose ring) | ✅ done | validated; ±75°/±90° views are low value |
| **L1** — view diversity only | ✅ done | solves lift, destroys square/can |
| **M3** — view-conditioned encoder + fusion | ✅ done | solves square/can at held-out views; conditioning inert |
| **M4** — per-view aux action heads | ✅ done | mechanism real, behaviourally null |
| **architectural confound** | ✅ resolved | multi-view sampling is the load-bearing ingredient |
| **N-diversity ladder** | ✅ closed at five rungs | a knee, then a graded rise; `[1,5]` is the more view-general working cell |
| **`[2,7]`** | ✅ done | enough views *on average* is the ingredient; N=1 inference needs no N=1 training samples |
| **M1 re-screen** | ✅ done | the single-view baseline was **not** collapsed — view-tiedness ≠ collapse |
| **M5** — single-novel-view inference | 🟡 capability **measured**, not pending | every M3 number is already an N=1 inference at a novel pose; only the optional distillation stage is uncoded |
| parked (encoder collapse, the `[1,3]` second failure mode, the balance refutation, the `m3v15` gap, instrument diagnostics) | ⬜ stopped, findings kept | reasoning and revival conditions at git tag `docs-full-20260930` |

## Out of scope for now

ACT. The mujoco pipeline — including the known normalizer bug at
`mujoco_image_dataset.py:64`, which fits `agent_pos` on `tcp_xyz_wxyz` concatenated with
*itself* (14 dims) instead of with `gripper_width`, and will fail against the 8-dim
`agent_pos` the dataset produces.
